GVF has been appointed as a nodal agency to facilitate this process under a Memorandum of Understanding entered into between Technical Education Department, Government of Haryana, NASSCOM Foundation and GVF.

<h1>Areas of Expertise:</h1>

<strong>GVF works on following areas of policy at present:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Rural Welfare:</strong><br>
        <p>
        Advised the Government of Haryana and accordingly helped the Government in 
        constituting clusters of 10-15 villages in each district. These clusters would be specialized 
        in producing agricultural products and agro processing based on market demands. They 
        all will be diverse depending on the ecological zone of the region. There are efforts made 
        for market linkages to ensure sound income for the farmers.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <strong>Skill Development:</strong><br>
        <p>

        NASSCOM Foundation, which is a nodal association in the IT industry. GVF is 
        organizing a Summit of IT CEOs and is going to take commitments from them to skill 
        and employ a certain number of students from Haryana each year. GVF is working on 
        similar lines in the automobile sector and other skill for ensuring self employment.</p>

        <strong>Energy Sector Reforms:</strong><br>
        <p>GVF has done a comprehensive study of losses suffered in generation, transmission and 
        distribution of power and on renewable sources. GVF is currently preparing a 
        comprehensive study with reforms to be suggested in all the related aspects of energy. 
        The comprehensive study is important. The Aggregate Technical and Commercial Losses 
        are more than 40%. This is a sign of concern since it is affecting the fiscal health of the 
        state and public interest. Due to this fiscal drain the State is unable to use the resources 
        for social and other economical development activities. Immediate steps need to be 
        taken to address these problems. GVF has a dedicated team of experts with detailed 
        knowledge of the problems in the power sector companies. The study will be watershed 
        in the field. It will have a strong impact and needs to be urgently addressed. A 
        comprehensive study on the power sector will be opportune.</p>
