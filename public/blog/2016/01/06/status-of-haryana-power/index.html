<h4>A. BACKGROUND</h4>

<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>An efficient, resilient and financially robust power sector is essential for industrial expansion, economic growth and thereby poverty reduction. It is a critical input for manufacturing, services, agriculture and other allied activities.</p></li>
<li><p>The power sector in Haryana was unbundled into four State owned Public Sector companies after the enactment of Electricity Act, 2003. So, now power sector in Haryana comprises of four companies, namely Haryana Power Generation Corporation Ltd. (HPGCL), Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Ltd. (HVPNL), Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. (UHBVN), Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. (DHBVN). As per the mandate of the act, the tariff charged by these companies is determined by an independent regulator i.e. the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC).</p></li>
<li><p>Although, Power sector is a regulated sector but the generation division had got delicensed and since then captive generation has been freely permitted. The interstate power trading is governed by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and intra state power trading is regulated by HERC.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of power availability, Haryana is a power surplus state. It has a power generation capacity (including long term sourcing arrangement from Adani power) of around 10,000 MW per annum, whereas demand for power in the state is around 4000 MW for non peak hours and around 6000 MW in peak hours, thus creating a position of power surplus.</p></li>
<li><p>While all the three sectors of power-generation, transmission and distribution are important, but revenues for the power sector originate with the consumer at the distribution, so subpar performance in distribution division thereby hurt the entire value chain. </p></li>
<li><p>Presently, the state has monopoly over the distribution sector. After achieving the Annual Gross Revenue of Rs 21500 crore the two companies in the distribution  suffer annual loss of around 3500 crore i.e.  NP to sales ratio is negative (around 16%).The average cost of purchase of power is around Rs3.90 per unit while average realisation per unit is around Rs.7.35. This indicates that the cost of serving the transaction is abnormally high.</p></li>
<li><p>With the central government proposing to bring an amendment in the electricity act of 2003 to provide retail competition and to allow power traders to participate in the distribution areas, a serious question arises that, are our state owned distribution companies ready to face the challenges?</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>B. CHALLENGES</h4>

<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>Even after being a power surplus state, the state cannot provide 24*7 electricity to its consumers. This is primarily due to the leakages and inefficiencies built in the distribution sector over the last so many years. The State is practically running sick companies to serve its people. The net worth of these distribution companies had already eroded long back. These companies carry a debt burden of around thirty thousand crores mainly to cover its losses.</p></li>
<li><p>The Generation companies are also not in a position to sell electricity in the open market because of its high cost of production as compared to the Open market Rate. For e.g. Adani Power sells power at Rs. 3.30 per unit (ex destination) Mahindergarh whereas Haryana produces power costing between Rs. 4 to 5.50 per unit (ex factory) and average transmission cost ranges around 50 paise depending upon the destination.</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution sector is plagued with huge level of theft prevalent mostly in the rural households and unauthorised colonies (Aggregate Technical &amp; Commercial Loss ranges between 26% to 36%). This along with the subsidy bill (to the farmer through the provisions of Budget) of around 6000 crore  is hitting the state hard. It is causing a direct and indirect loss to the state amounting to Rs. 9428 crores (planning commission) whereas the total budgetary resources available to state (including both tax and non tax revenues) are around 40,000 crores i.e. 24% of the total resources of the state is being spent on covering the loss. </p></li>
<li><p>Comparing these figures with the budgetary allocation to other sectors, the situation looks even worse. The budget allocated to health is only around Rs. 3000 crores, 2800 crore Rs is allocated to Urban Development and State Police has a budget of around Rs3000 crore. Clearly, with such huge losses and cost in the distribution sector, the state is not in a position to allocate funds to other important sectors.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>C. WAYSAHEAD</h4>

<hr>

<p>The Management, Operations and Finances of the distribution companies must be improved on an immediate basis. This will not only improve the condition of the state finances but also the image of the government among the public at large in providing public services efficiently.</p>

<p>In our view, the losses of the distribution sector can be addressed in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There can be two ways to handle these huge losses, one is to increase the revenue and the other is to cut the costs. Revenues can be increased by using innovative ways to generate non tariff Income. For instance, polls owned by these companies can be rented away to install/put up digital cables/optical fibres. So, this will generate rent income for distribution companies. We can add some Innovative services and can charge service fee. Some lessons can be learnt from our banks which have recently adopted service based fee apart from the controlled segment of Interest leverage. Likewise, the distribution companies can set up Tatkaal Connection or 24 hour van service and dedicated call centres to address the grievance against some user charges. This will give additional income and will also increase customer satisfaction level. </p></li>
<li><p>The second way is to increase the revenues in a phased manner. In the urban areas, temporary connection can be given to the unauthorised colonies. Whereas for rural areas where power theft is rampant Franchise Model of bill recovery can be set up by incentivising local people to collect the bills and end theft.</p></li>
<li><p>The other way to handle the huge losses is to contain the costs. This can be done by optimising the power Purchase at minimum possible cost. There should also be a proper audit of the expenses of these companies.</p></li>
<li><p>The third way is to increase the volume where revenue realisation is full by creating separate Customer Relationship manager. </p></li>
<li><p>So, the state power utility companies have to realise first that they are service providers to the society and that they are running a Commercial Enterprise. Hence, they are answerable to all the stakeholders including Owners, Customers, Employees, Lenders, Regulators and society at large. The entire Board has to take a professional approach and should engage with the large consulting houses in the area of management, information technology (IT) and commercial law. </p></li>
<li><p>Surprisingly, there are no robust HR practices in state power utilities, whereas HR is the utmost important asset for any Service Providing company. Well Defined Selection process, Regular Training system to upgrade the skills set, attitude level, Performance evaluation Process, Remuneration and incentive mechanism is imperative to attract and retain the talent in the system so as to create a successful company.</p></li>
<li><p>If the companies in the distribution division of the power sector get crippled by the competition caused by private companies, the state might have to bear the burden of debt of about 30,000 crores. In order to prevent such a situation and solve the above mentioned problems of the power sector an immediate interference by professionals is required. It is also high time now that accounting reforms be introduced in these companies to align their accounting practices with any other private company. Also, an active and professional board, the introduction of IT techniques, best management practices more particularly HR, bringing in experts in power sector is immediately needed.</p></li>
